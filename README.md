Simple chat shenanigans in Nim!
Now featuring _extremely_ weak encryption!

**DO NOT USE THIS FOR ANYTHING THAT MATTERS AND MUST REMAIN SECRET.** This encryption is cracked within less of a second using any modern device, not to mention bugs or mistakes in the programming or in the algorithm. I bet it is easier to watch the socket and write an algorithm to crack it then what it was to create this program.
